[DONE] 1. Make the created records delete when the test script failed (done - delete from the world object sysIDArr)
[DONE] 2. Make it so that when a record is generated through UI steps, the sys_id of that record is saved in the customWorld object: SysIDArr
[DONE] 3. Modify ServiceNow instance so that it doesn't show the welcome modals for first time users. (Done)

[DONE] 4. Make it also when the scenario complete, test data is rolled back
    Dev notes: Added an environment variable ROLLBACK, if ROLLBACK==='Y' then rollback, else do nothing
[DONE] 5. improve the way sys_id is stored should also contain the table name or and api endpoint
    Dev notes: I made it so that the sysIDArr also store the table name for the table for that record
[DONE] 6. Modify the prepareTestData.deleteRecord so that it can delete record from any table
[DONE] 7. Add API endpoint to constants.json
    Dev notes: added TABLES and TABLE_API constants


[DONE] 8. Refactor Given When Then steps into separate files
[DONE] 9. Add a landing page object model
[DONE] 10. Make the All menu (Navigation filter) pinned for all users
    -create records in sys_user_preference: https://dev204202.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/sys_user_preference.do%3Fsys_id%3D756c9992935946109c6436befaba1042%26sysparm_record_target%3Dsys_user_preference%26sysparm_record_row%3D1%26sysparm_record_rows%3D3%26sysparm_record_list%3DnameSTARTSWITHglide.ui.menu.main.pinned.id%255EORDERBYname

[DONE] 10. Add a logic when a step fail, after data rollback complete, set sysIDArr to empty to prevent data rollback twice
[DONE] 11. Add a randomized ID to data creation to prevent future error when data rollback failed
[DONE] 12. Remove all demo data, leave only SN data
[DONE] 13. Fix fill in mandatory fields logic to use the newly created users record instead of fieldValues.json
14. Implement filter and search for application modules instead of using url
15. Refactor codes to follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
16. Code review to add more meaningful logs and also try catch block
17. Further develop SOW scenario
18. Fix SOW steps to be more reusable
19. Add logic to get all the mandatory fields in a form
    Notes: maybe use label to determine which is a mandatory field. Because each field type has a different way at showing it is a mandatory field
20. Modify fillInMandatoryFields so it is reusable. Succeeded in getting the mandatory fields in a form
